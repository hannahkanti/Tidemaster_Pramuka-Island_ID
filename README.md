# *Tidemaster Field Survey Data: Tidal Measurements on Pramuka Island, June 2024*
This repository contains tidal data collected from Pramuka Island, located in the Thousand Islands (Kepulauan Seribu), Indonesia with coordinate 5°44'45.99"S 106°36'42.71"E. The dataset is valuable for analyzing tidal patterns, supporting coastal studies, and aiding in ecological and environmental monitoring in the region.

## **Data Collection**
The tidal data was collected between 14 June 2024 and 22 June 2024 as part of the 2024 Hydro-Oceanographic Survey Field Course conducted by the Oceanography Program, Institut Teknologi Bandung. This fieldwork aimed to provide students with hands-on experience in coastal monitoring and data analysis using advanced oceanographic instruments, including Tidemaster sensors. The measurements were taken every 15 minutes over a span of 8 days.

## **Data Source**
The tidal data was collected using Tidemaster sensors installed on Pramuka Island. These sensors recorded tidal levels continuously throughout the field course, generating high-resolution data suitable for various analyses.
